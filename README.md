# face-recognition
This is an openCV,tensorflow,Flask,android implementation allowing for efficient face recognition. 
The aim of this project is to show a naive implementation of a face recognition system. The capturecode.py which is running on a laptop is symbolic of a cctv and the image extracted provides updates on an android app to the respective user.

# testing
The retrained_graph.pb and retrained_labels.txt have not been provided as a part of this source. This can easily be achieved by simply retraining TensorFlow's inceptionV3 model. 

refer to : https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/#0

The code for creating your own data set as well as for obtaining an input from the webcam has been provided through capture.py and capturecode.py respectively. (can be found in processing)
